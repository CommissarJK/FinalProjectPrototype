# FinalProjectPrototype

This is the Final version of my Final Project for my university degree.

It was made in the Unity engine using C# as the coding language.

The game is a procedurally generated Japanese style roleplaying game using a similar style of generation that you would see in hex based 4X strategy games like Civilization to create the overworld.  And uses traditional mechanics found in older roleplaying games for the turn based combat mechanics.

The main code is in the scripts folder inside the assets folder and is broken up into different folders based on where it is used in the game.
